/**
Hashing
Hashing is a process where data is mapped to a fixed-size value (called a hash) using a hash function.
The hash function takes an input (e.g., a string or a number) and produces a deterministic and fixed-size output.

Characteristics of a Good Hash Function
    - Deterministic: The same input always produces the same output.
    - Uniform Distribution: Outputs are evenly distributed, minimizing collisions.
    - Fast Computation: The hash function should be efficient to compute.
    - Collision Resistance: It minimizes the likelihood of two different inputs producing the same hash (though it can't eliminate it).
